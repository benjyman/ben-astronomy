#ASSASSIN: (All Sky SigAl Short SPacing INterferometer)
#Script to replicate Cath's global step simulations

#Generate model visibilities
#1. Get a sky model (healpix map of GSM2017) - easy
#2. Get a beam model in healpix (not entirely straightforward, but I think I have done this before) just use short dipole model.
#3. Generate a point source model (I don't understand how this is done)
#4. Generate a global EoR signal (I think I understand how to do this from Cath's eqn 3 etc
 
#Get EDA antenna positions (you have these)

#Use zenith pointing centre and phase centre of RA = 4h, Dec.= âˆ’27 degrees

#Generate simulated visibilities ... with miriad to start?
